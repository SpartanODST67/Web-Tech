			<hr>
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<p>I am a <a href="https://sciences.utsa.edu/computer-science/"><u>Computer Science major at the University of Texas At San Antonio</u></a>. I have taken all the classes of the software engineering concentration and currently on my last semester here. It has been a long journey to get to this point. My computer science experience started all the way back during my second year of middle school but didn't really kick off until my freshman year of high school. I find myself to be a really creative person, but I lack the creative skills such as art or music though I am very diligent at math. <i>Computer Science</i> and <i>Software Engineering</i> allows me to use my creative side with my logical side.</p>

				<p>I find myself to be really obssessive with the things I like <i>(though not as obssessive as other people).</i> I prefer to binge the sereies that I enjoy. Persona 3 Reload came out <i>two weeks ago</i>. It's roughly a <b>100 hour long game</b>, and <i>I already finished it.</i> With how much I enjoy games and software development, it should be no suprise that I want to become a game developer. The dream is to become an indie developer, but that has a low chance of working out. However, I can still live to dream.</p>
